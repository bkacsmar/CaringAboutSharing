# CaringAboutSharing

This repository contains two files supplemental for the replication and interpretation of the work in the paper "Caring about Sharing: User Perceptions of Multiparty Data Sharing" to appear at USENIX Security 2022. 

The first file consists of a pdf of the SurveyMonkey layout of the survey that participants would see (though this output shows all scenarios and questions, not just what one individual would see). Note that the survey includes opening and closing text as per the University of Waterloo's office of research ethics. This study received approval under ORE #: 41762. 

Each survey respondent received one of the twelve scenarios (labeled A-L) from the survey text pdf. 
The ordering of questions two through four were ordered randomly for each participant. The final questions always included the attention checking question, followed by the privacy mechanism question, the free-form response question, and the ending with demographics.

The second file consists of expanded details of the statistical analysis performed over the survey data.
